# This is just basic way of using git and github.
# There are multiple ways of doing it but this is my personal preference.

Step 1: Make a repository in github.
Step 2: Copy the ssh link from there.
Step 3: Use terminal/CMD/Powershell and $git clone git@github.com:{username}/{repository name}.git
Step 4: Make changes
Step 5: git add .(it refers to any change you have made in the current directory or you can specify specefic file replace . with file/folder name) 
Step 6: git commit -m "Your custom messages"
Step 7: git push (Pushes your local changes to the repository)
Step 7: git pull (Pulls changes from your github to the local repository)

***You can always use $git --help to get help menu***
